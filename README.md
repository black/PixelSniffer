# Pixel Sniffer

This project showcases a demo of a pixel tracking system designed to collect user interaction data for analytical purposes. It simulates the behavior of a web pixel tracker, capturing and sending data on user activities, which can be used for performance analysis, targeted marketing, or other tracking needs.

The demo provides a simple implementation, with clear instructions on how to integrate it into websites or apps for testing and experimentation. The goal is to demonstrate the core functionality of a pixel tracker in a controlled environment.
